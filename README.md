# QuantumWalks
This Mathematica package defines some basic function to ease the handling and simulation of discrete time quantum walks in some simple scenarios.

The [`QM`](https://github.com/lucainnocenti/QM) package is required for proper functioning.

See [`QuantumWalksDemonstrations.nb`](./QuantumWalksDemonstrations.nb) for some usage examples.
